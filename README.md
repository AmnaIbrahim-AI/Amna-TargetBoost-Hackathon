# 🎯 TargetBoost AI

**No budget? No ads? No problem.**
TargetBoost AI is a smart assistant that helps entrepreneurs in restricted countries like Sudan reach their ideal audience—**without paid ads or technical background**.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Sudan and many other countries are banned from using ad platforms like Meta and Google Ads. Most entrepreneurs in these places can't afford premium tools.
As a beginner in AI and digital marketing, I joined the [Google Cloud ADK Hackathon](https://googlecloudmultiagents.devpost.com/) to learn how AI can solve this problem.

## 🧠 How It Works

This is a simplified **multi-agent system** using Google tools:

| Agent           | Function                                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🟢 **Form Agent** | Collects product descriptions using Google Forms          |
| 🟡 **Sheet Agent** | Stores and manually labels training data in Google Sheets |
| 🔵 **Gemini Agent** | Analyzes input and gives smart targeting recommendations |

The system predicts the ideal audience **based on AI simulation (Gemini)** trained on real, labeled examples.

## 🛠 Tools I Used

-   🧩 **Google Cloud**
-   📝 **Google Forms** – for collecting product descriptions
-   📊 **Google Sheets** – for storing and labeling data
-   🧠 **Gemini AI (Gemini 1.5)** – simulating AI responses
-   🧪 **Google Colab** – for testing model logic
-   🌐 **Google Sites** – for a simple front-end interface
-   🔄 **Zapier** – automating the workflow
-   🐍 **Python** – used in Gemini prompts
-   🧰 **No-Code approach** throughout the system

## 🧱 Challenges I Faced

-   I built the entire project using **only my phone**
-   I had no access to a laptop or full coding environment
-   Constant copy-paste errors while using Colab on mobile
-   No experience with Google Cloud before this hackathon
-   Learning to use AI tools like Gemini and Zapier from scratch

---

## 🎓 What I Learned

-   Basics of multi-agent system design
-   Prompt engineering with Gemini
-   Using Google Cloud & no-code automation
-   Building AI logic without technical background
-   That AI can empower creators even in restricted regions

---

## 🔗 Connection to Google Cloud ADK

While I didn’t use the official ADK codebase directly, **TargetBoost AI follows the multi-agent logic promoted by ADK**.

The project simulates three agents using Google tools:

-   **Form Agent**: Input collector
-   **Sheet Agent**: Data organizer
-   **Gemini Agent**: Reasoning and decision-maker

All agents interact to mimic a distributed agent system, using no-code AI tools from Google Cloud.

## 🏆 Final Note

Even if I don’t win, I’m proud I finished this project against all odds.
This proves that with determination, even someone with no tech background, no budget, and no laptop can still create real solutions.

Let this inspire anyone in restricted or underserved regions 🌍
