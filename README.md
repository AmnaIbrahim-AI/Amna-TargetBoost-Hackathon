   # TargetBoost AI: Smart Audience Targeting for Restricted Regions

## Project Overview
TargetBoost AI is an innovative solution designed to empower entrepreneurs in countries with limited advertising access (e.g., due to geo-restrictions or lack of local ad platforms). Our tool helps them identify and target precise customer segments by analyzing product descriptions and leveraging AI-driven insights, even without traditional advertising methods or large budgets.

## The Challenge
Entrepreneurs in restricted regions often face significant hurdles in reaching their target customers. Traditional advertising platforms might be inaccessible, too expensive, or lack local relevance. Our project aims to bridge this gap by providing an intelligent, accessible, and cost-effective audience targeting mechanism.

## Development Journey & Adaptation (Code to No-Code)

Our project began with ambitions for a fully code-based solution, utilizing Python and Google Cloud AI services. This Colab notebook (`TargetBoost_AI_Initial_Code.ipynb`) demonstrates our initial programming efforts, including:
* Setting up the development environment.
* Installing necessary Google Cloud and Generative AI libraries (e.g., `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `google-generativeai`).
* Initial attempts at data processing and API integration.

However, we encountered significant technical challenges during this phase, primarily due to:
* **Mobile Environment Limitations:** Developing and debugging complex Python code directly on a mobile phone proved to be highly challenging.
* **Persistent Copy-Pasting Issues:** Frequent and frustrating problems with copying and pasting code snippets severely hindered our development pace.

These practical limitations led us to make a strategic pivot. We decided to implement the core logic of TargetBoost AI using a robust **no-code methodology**, simulating the functionality of an Agent Development Kit (ADK) through accessible Google tools.

## No-Code Solution Architecture

Our adapted solution leverages the power of Google's ecosystem to provide a functional and effective audience targeting tool without extensive coding:

1.  **Data Collection (Google Forms):** Entrepreneurs submit their product descriptions and business details through a user-friendly Google Form. This form acts as the initial data input mechanism, replacing a complex coded frontend.
    * **Live Google Form:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU3J4QcSin-9E7NphZnfUT4pmH6e1K24C_yYef47FYCibOQg/viewform?usp=header

2.  **Data Management (Google Sheets):** All submissions from the Google Form is automatically compiled and structured in a Google Sheet. This serves as our backend database, making data easily accessible and manageable.

3.  **AI-Powered Analysis (Gemini AI):** Gemini AI is used to analyze the product descriptions and other submitted data. Through direct interaction (or simple scripts/add-ons), Gemini effectively acts as:
    * **Audience Identifier:** Extracts key attributes, target demographics, and psychographics from the product description.
    * **Persona Refiner:** Develops detailed buyer personas based on the extracted insights.
    * **Recommendation Agent:** Generates actionable recommendations for marketing angles, messaging, and platforms best suited for the identified audience.

4.  **Demonstration:** The output from Gemini AI (audience insights and recommendations) is then used by the entrepreneur to refine their marketing strategy manually, or could be presented back via a simple interface (e.g., Google Sites) if further integration was pursued.

## Impact
TargetBoost AI empowers entrepreneurs in challenging environments by providing them with critical market insights and targeting strategies, enabling them to reach their audience effectively and grow their businesses despite traditional limitations. This project demonstrates resilience and innovation in utilizing available resources to solve real-world problems.
