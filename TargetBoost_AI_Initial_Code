However, we encountered significant technical challenges, especially related to code execution and persistent copy-pasting issues on mobile devices. These hurdles made direct coding development impractical for our team.\n","\n","Consequently, we adapted our strategy, pivoting towards a no-code methodology. We focused on simulating the core logic of the Agent Development Kit (ADK) using readily available Google tools like Google Forms, Google Sheets, and the power of Gemini AI, thereby delivering a functional solution despite technical limitations.\n","\n","This notebook showcases our initial coding efforts and explains the strategic shift that led to our no-code solution."],"metadata":{"id":"AHsqso3jJJH1"}}]}
